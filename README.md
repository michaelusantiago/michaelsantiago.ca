## This is my personal website

Written in SvelteKit, TypeScript. I used PocketBase as my backend CMS (something like that). It is actually SQLite database.

## It is capable of registering friends.
Yes, you can sign-up and make me a friend. Once you do, you can chat with me **privately** and **securely**. Absolutely just *you* and *me*, nothing in between. I guess that's the beauty of it. You can make sure that I am the only one keeping our conversations (of course my site host as well).

## What's Up?
Similar to Post in common social media platforms. So, you can see updates about me. This is not blog, I won't do some kind of TLDR (Too Long, Don't Read) thing. I have no skill in teaching I guess, but you can follow me and serve's me the purpose of a guide somehow.
